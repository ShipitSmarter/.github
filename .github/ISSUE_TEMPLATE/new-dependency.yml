      Thanks for taking the time to fill out this report ðŸ¤—

      A dependency is something that you include in your code at build time: something like a nuget package. This will help us to improve the quality of new dependencies that we take in.

      Make sure to 'fixate' your dependency version (specify the version or use a https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-lock-json): we always want the build to be predictable.
